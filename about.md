Hello. My name is Ben and I'm currently a third year studying 
[Mathematics-Computer Science](http://math.ucsd.edu/programs/undergraduate/
bs_math_comp_science.php) at UCSD. My interests currently lie in data
visualization and even though I've just started I'm really interested in
learning how it's done.
