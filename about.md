Hello. My name is Ben and I'm currently a second year studying 
[Mathematics-Computer Science](http://math.ucsd.edu/programs/undergraduate/
bs_math_comp_science.php) at UCSD. My interests currently lie in data
visualization and even though I've just started I'm really interested in
learning how it's done. I'm also working on becoming an actuary as well, so
I'm also studying to take the [SOA P exam](https://soa.org/education/exam-req/
edu-exam-p-detail.aspx) which I'll take probably in the fall.
