Hello! My name is Ben and I have a Bachelor of Science in [Mathematics-Computer Science](https://archive.fo/l7ekb) from UCSD. My interests currently lie in data visualization and full stack web development. Recently I've taken a liking to learning about the hottest technologies being used. I dislike redundancy and appreciate configurability balanced with simplicity. I have experience in rapid prototyping, wireframing, theming, and high contrast accessibility. I always give 120%, uphold my code quality to stringent requirements, and am always interested in learning how to improve.
