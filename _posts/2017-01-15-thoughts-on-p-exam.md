Well I've just passed the SOA P Exam yesterday. And I have a few thoughts
about the test prep process as well as resources I'd like to share.

## P Exam
My initial thought is that the exam is fairly easier than the prep material I
used. Which was the Broverman ACTEX study manual. The practice exams were
grossly inaccurate representations of the actual difficulty level. Not sure
how much I can talk about the exam

## Resources

# Freebies
There's this awesome professor, [MB Finan, at ATU who made free
study manuals](http://faculty.atu.edu/mfinan/actuaries.html) for all the
preliminary exams. The best part is that unlike the other study manuals
out there, his is written in latex. The math is just so much easier to read
than whatever was used to typeset Broverman's study manual. At some point
Broverman was using \\(\phi\\) instead of \\(\varnothing\\) to denote the 
empty set.

Also, I found the free practice exams at [The Infinte Actuary](http://www.theinfiniteactuary.com/) 
to be the most accurate in representing the difficulty level of the actual 
exam.

There's also these websites with compilations of free resources for the
preliminary exams, they include compilations of past exam questions too:

* [University of Chicago](https://ucactuarialinitiative.wordpress.com/study-materials/)
* [Michigan State University](https://actuarialscience.natsci.msu.edu/useful-links/resources-for-exam-preparation/)

That's basically the free resources that I've encountered so far.

# Expensive Stuff
For the stuff you have to pay for, you can buy the study manuals off of
The Actuarial Bookstore or the ACTEX website. Although, you aren't only
limited to the study manuals, there's also textbooks that have been
reviewed by SOA and they're nice enough to list out the relevant sections
of each of the reviewed texts.

## Broverman Study Manual Review
Apparently Broverman's P Exam study manual was supposed to be
cream of the crop, I however, feel differently at least for the 2015 edition.
The diagrams illustrating concepts and the math equations didn't look as crisp
as you would expect from a textbook or document from a professor. Additionally,
I wonder where the editors were looking, as mentioned earlier, when the wrong
symbols were used. Also, the grouped SOA questions, didn't correspond to the chapters they 
were assigned to. I also felt the chapters didn't really teach much, and instead 
just listed a bunch of properties to memorize. You're better off studying
off of some free probability course on Coursera, wikipedia for distributions,
and practicing doing calculus.
