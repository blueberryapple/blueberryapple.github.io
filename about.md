Hello! My name is Ben and I have a Bachelor of Science in [Mathematics-Computer Science](https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~handbook/undergraduate/ma30-math-computer-science-b-s/) from UCSD. My interests currently lie in data visualization and full stack web development. I have experience in rapid prototyping, wireframing, theming, and high contrast. Even though I've just started my career, I'm always interested in learning how to improve.
